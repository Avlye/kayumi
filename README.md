# Kayumi Code

A fictional and universal language based on *Lah li et* stories.

This repo is an open-source language definition for Kayumi.

## Motivations

At 7 years old, I had a dream sequence which I call *Lah li et*,
which would last for years in that sequence. This repository is not
to tell what happened in those dreams and exclude in open letters
the communication standard used by that universe.

## Context

To begin to understand this language, it is necessary to know the beginning of
story of *Lah li et*, called the poetry of everything.

Here is my simplified version:

<pre>
It was a bland and flat world
Or better saying
There was nothing
The Void was his only identity

How to describe what doesn't exist?
Perhaps that is the point
Not being described is his greatest virtue, however ...
It didn't take long for Void to become an entity
An entity that soon realized
There was no reason for the non-existence

Void then created something he called existence
In a tiny space and a simple orb

The orb then began to learn its own nature
And evolved into a conscious being
Still very young and just like every child
Playing everywhere, exploring everything she could

Soon began to have dreams
And with dreams, she felt the need to name things
But how to call yourself?
So that's it, her name is Kayu.
It would be so nice to have someone to call her that.

It was then that she finally realized
Your name, your dreams, just don't make sense if you live alone.
Kayu then started to feel lonely
She created tears to express herself
Loneliness easily becomes sadness.

The Void began to pay attention to that
And the question of whether there was reason to exist
So he decided to take a part of himself
Small energy capable of communicating with Kayu.
Not through words, but actions.

Kayu finally felt alive
Told dreams of how everything could be
Then the Void presented her with enough material to make everything the way she wanted.
But she, in her innocence, decided that it was better to use all that to create seeds.

The Void failed to understand
Why waste your only option to make your dreams come true?
Kayu increasingly talked to the Void
Played make-believe to all sides in the vastness of the void

That void energy also received a peculiar name
Simply, void
Void began to question itself more and more
Even though I didn't realize it, I was sadder
How is it possible for emptiness to feel sadness?
How is it possible that something does not exist to feel?

Void then realized that part of Kayu influenced him
The Void got his name, the void learned to cry
Void finally realized that he wanted to feel alive as Kayu.

Kayu noticing his sadness, even though she couldn't hear him
She also started to cry, her tears spread to where the seeds were
The seeds absorbed Kayu's feelings.

Those seeds became a small seedling,
but Kayu no longer existed in that place
Void, however, gifted by Kayu, came into existence.
However, he realized what it was necessary to feel alive
It wasn't the existence, but being with Kayu

Void merged all your feelings in that little seedling
In a short time, this seedling became a tree.
And its first fruit was called *Lah li et*.
